          JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/),[10] often abbreviated JS, is a
          programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World
          Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.[11] As of 2022, 98% of websites use
          JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior,[12] often
          incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers have a
          dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

          The first web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was
          released in 1993. Accessible to non-technical people, it played a
          prominent role in the rapid growth of the nascent World Wide Web.[15]
          The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation,
          which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994.
          This quickly became the most-used.

          Microsoft debuted Internet Explorer in 1995, leading to a browser war
          with Netscape. On the JavaScript front, Microsoft reverse-engineered
          the Navigator interpreter to create its own, called JScript.[20]

          In November 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International,
          as the starting point for a standard specification that all browser
          vendors could conform to. This led to the official release of the
          first ECMAScript language specification in June 1997.

          During the period of Internet Explorer dominance in the early 2000s,
          client-side scripting was stagnant. This started to change in 2004,
          when the successor of Netscape, Mozilla, released the Firefox browser.
          Firefox was well received by many, taking significant market share
          from Internet Explorer.

          Ambitious work on the language continued for several years,
          culminating in an extensive collection of additions and refinements
          being formalized with the publication of ECMAScript 6 in 2015.

          JavaScript is the dominant client-side scripting language of the Web,
          with 98% of all websites (mid–2022) using it for this purpose.[12]
          Scripts are embedded in or included from HTML documents and interact
          with the DOM. All major web browsers have a built-in JavaScript engine
          that executes the code on the user's device.

          The use of JavaScript has expanded beyond its web browser roots.
          JavaScript engines are now embedded in a variety of other software
          systems, both for server-side website deployments and non-browser
          applications.
